1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
In this assignment we were tasked with adding a registration and login page to our current website while adding criteria to it like making sure the passwords are case sensitive, requiring passwords to have at least 7 letters, and so forth. We have also been tasked with redirecting our purchases to a login/registration page before going to the invoice. 
2. What did you learn from this assignment?
I have learned that when you create a webstore there's a lot of things you have to do in order to have it function properly. When thinking of processes and data you have to think about how each data is passed onto the next pages. I was recommended to use server sessions but since we haven’t gone over that yet I had to find another way to move my data from one page to the next. I was able to do that by appending the data onto the URL (which isn’t recommended for security reasons) but I had to make do with what I had. 
3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I did not work with a partner. 
4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I got a lot of help from ChatGPT and the notes/videos of our lectures during class. This is my first time ever coding and it was quite overwhelming. I get what the task is asking for the majority of the time but it’s just figuring out how to tell the computer that made it difficult. Some of the things I still struggle with are loops. I have trouble finding ways to make them without confusing the computer or myself for that matter. 
5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
The main difference is that in assignment 1 we built a simple website, whereas assignment 2 is where we create an entirely different path of validating user data for example the login and registration data to get to the invoice page. Assignment 1 was our foundation and assignment 2 is where we make it better and more personalized for the user. 
6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing), (c) testing and debugging
a. 25%
b. 15%
c. 60%
7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
One thing that worked well for this project was creating the login and registration pages (thanks to CW3 schools template). The things that didn’t work well was doing all of the small criteria for login passwords, emails, and so forth. I had a lot of trouble with moving the data to the right pages and having them transfer again to the end page. 
8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
I would have made my code more user friendly (easy to read and better comments) so that I could navigate through my code quicker for faster debugging.
