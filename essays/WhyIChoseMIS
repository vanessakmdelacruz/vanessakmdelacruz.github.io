I initially never looked at business as a future for me until I took a test to see what areas of work I would do well in. I had a lot of business jobs come up in my interests. My dad would always tell me to go into cybersecurity and I slowly got curious about working with computers. I then proceeded to look up business and computer degrees. I came to the revelation that management information systems was that sweetspot of my interests.

Even though the course isn't what my family had in mind they are still very happy that I've found something I like and am passionate in pursuing. I am not the most tech savvy person but I know with time and work I can get there. I have always loved problem solving and I feel that this major will definitely have me using all my knowledge to come up with a solution I don't have a textbook answer for.

I am not sure what job I want to look for after this but hopefully as time goes by I can narrow down my options. I hope to become knowledgeable enough about computers to the point that I am confident enough to solve my own problems.
