summary: "My preparation for WODs."

The WOD for browser history 6 had us split the previous browser history that we’ve worked on into separate web pages with buttons on the front page that could take you to the other histories of the browsers. In the smartphone products WOD we are taking out the hard code and replacing it with variables. In the invoice WOD we create a table using variables and expressions. There was also a little bit of math that confused me the first time around. 

I prepared for the first WOD by reading the instructions and tried going through it without watching the video. For the browser history 6 WOD  I had a bit of a difficult time the first time around because the images weren’t spacing the way they showed in the picture. After a long time of trying different things and searching on ChatGPT on how to fix it and still not getting it I watched the screen cast. After watching the screen cast I was able to finish the WOD in 21 minutes and 33 seconds. I did the same thing I’ve done through the other labs which was read over the instructions then go over the screencast afterwards. It really helps to kind of figure it out on your own until you get stuck and get help with the recording to see where you go wrong. 

The WOD on smartphone products  from what I can recall was difficult for me. The first time I had difficulty with the 7th step which was a bit more of the chunk of the problem. I then proceeded to look at the screencast and started the 2nd screencast. I panicked again and quit before the time was up because I got stuck again. I should’ve just let the time keep rolling while I figured it out because I don’t think I would’ve exceeded time. Nevertheless I started my last go, and finally made the time in 12 minutes and 13 seconds. I prepped the same way I did in the previous lab. Only improvement I would make is to stop giving up before the time limit has exceeded because of fear of going over the time limit. 

Invoice 1 WOD was a lot on the eyes. It took me two tries on this not just because it was a lot on the eyes, but also trying to figure out the equation aspect of the coding. I’m not the best person when it comes to math so this portion got me stumped. Thankfully afterwards I was able to watch the video on it and take notes on the math portion. After that I still had a hard time looking at everything. I think it’s just a lot of the same code copied and pasted over and over so my eyes just kept crossing doing it. 

A good thing to do is to try the WOD out before watching the video because it gets you thinking as well as trying to problem solve things you’re not sure of. I know I get stuck on a lot of these WODs which is why sometimes when I know I can’t get past a certain step I start to watch the solution while I go through it (even though it goes past the time).
